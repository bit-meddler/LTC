# LTC Tools
Linear Timecode

This is a long standing protocol for syncronizing media ingest devices, including cine cameras, audio recorders, mocap systems, broadcast video cameras, digital cine cameras, etc.

The main experiment is to interpret an LTC signal using an http://www.espruino.com/ based microcontroller.

I'm currently blocked by not having a convenient LTC source anymore to test.

As gw identifies 2400Hz is at the limit of the ESP's sampling capacity.  So I may need to write this as c module for ESP, but it's nice to give something to the comunity.
